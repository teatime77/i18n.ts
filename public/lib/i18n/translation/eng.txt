23:Suppose two lines intersect.

24:There are four angles around the intersection.

25:These two angles are called vertical angles.

26:These two angles are also called vertical angles.

27:The vertical angles are equal to each other.

28:We prove this.

29:Let this angle be gamma.

30:therefore

31:This completes the proof that the vertical angles are equal.

32:The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.

33:We will prove this.

34:Draw a line parallel to one side of the triangle and through the vertex.

35:As these two lines are parallel

36:These two alternate angles are equal.

37:Similarly, as these two lines are parallel

38:The sum of these three angles is 180 degrees.

39:Therefore, the sum of these angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

40:This completes the proof.

41:We will draw the angle bisector.

42:Draw an arc.

43:Find the intersection of the arc and the line.

44:Draw an arc with the same radius.

45:Find the intersection of two arcs.

46:Draw a half-line.

47:We prove that this line is an angle bisector.

48:These are the radii of the same arc, so they have the same length.

49:Since the radii of these two arcs are the same,

50:The two lines have the same length.

51:The two triangles are congruent because they have equal sides.

52:Since the two triangles are congruent, corresponding angles are equal.

53:This completes the proof that this line is an angle bisector.

54:We draw a perpendicular line from a point on a line

55:Draw an arc centered on this point.

56:Draw an arc centered on the intersection.

57:Draw an arc of the same radius centered at another intersection.

58:Draw a line from the intersection of the arcs to a point on the line.

59:This angle is a right angle.

60:These two lines are perpendicular to each other.

61:This concludes the drawing.

62:We will draw the perpendicular bisector.

63:Draw a circle centered on this point.

64:Draw a circle of the same radius with the center at another point.

65:Find the intersection of two circles.

66:Draw a line connecting the two intersections.

67:There is one intersection between the two lines.

68:Therefore this line is a perpendicular bisector.

69:We draw parallel lines.

70:Draw a perpendicular line to the line.

71:Draw a perpendicular line to this perpendicular line.

72:These two lines are said to be parallel.

73:Suppose there are two parallel lines.

74:Drop a perpendicular line from one parallel line to the other.

75:Drop a perpendicular line from a different position.

76:The lengths of these perpendicular lines are always equal.

77:This is called the parallel lines axiom.

78:Suppose there two parallel lines and one line that intersects them.

79:These two angles are called alternate angles.

80:These two angles are also alternate angles.

81:The alternate angles of parallel lines are equal to each other.

82:Draw a perpendicular line from the intersection to another parallel line.

83:Draw another perpendicular line from the intersection to the line.

84:This angle is also a right angle.

85:Since these lines are parallel.

86:The lengths of these segments are equal.

87:Similarly, since these lines are parallel.

88:The two triangles are congruent because the lengths of the corresponding sides are equal and the angles between the two sides are right angles.

89:We prove that the two lines are perpendicular to each other.

90:These are the radii of the same arc.

91:So they have the same length.

92:We show that the two triangles are congruent.

93:These two sides are equal.

94:This side is common.

95:Because the three corresponding sides are equal,

96:the two triangles are congruent.

97:These corresponding angles are equal.

98:The sum of the two angles is 180 degrees.

99:So each angle is a right angle.

100:Therefore, the two lines are perpendicular to each other.
